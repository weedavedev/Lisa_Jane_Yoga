# Creating a buisness card website

Creating a slightly more complicated sveltekit website, This one will have abit more focus on the CSS side of things, just started using tailwind CSS for this!

## Technical-ish stuff

The framework is SvelteKit again, locally developed in Webstorm, built using vite and Tailwind CSS.
Github is doing the hosting through the pages feature and I have my domains DNS nameservers settings pointing here.
